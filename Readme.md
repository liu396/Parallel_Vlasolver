### 2. **Problem Description**

**Physical Processes Need to be Studied in the Plasma Flow of Electric Propulsion Thrusters**
* Electrons in plasma expansion problems are proven to be non-equilibrium, fluid desscription is not valid anymore.
* Electrons' temperature is proven to be anisotropic, thermodynamics and energy transfer process need to be studied.
* Kinetic Method need to be used instead of fluid method to resolve physical processes.

**Low Noise Method is Needed to Resolve Physical Processes**
* Numerical noise will combine with physical processes and make the physical processes hard to be studied.
* Particle-based kinetic method is easy to be implemented but with big numerical noise. Grid-based kinetic method have no-inherent numerical noise but with huge computational cost.
* Parallel grid-based kinetic method need to be developed.

### 3. **Methods and Techniques**
**Algorithms**
* Semi-Lagrangian time stepping.
* Third Order Positive Flux Conservation [1] method on phase domain discretization. 

**Parallelization**
* Thread Parallelization: ***OpenMP***
* Domain Decomposition: ***OpenMPI***
* Inhomogeneous Parallelization: ***CUDA[2]***

### 4. **Expected Results**
* Improve the computational efficency of the original ***Vlasover***
* Keep the possiblity of achieving higher dimensional ***Vlasolver***
